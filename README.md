 - [x] Train (two months) and test (latest week or 2 weeks) subsets for model to avoid overfitting.
 - [x] Summary code in body of the report and full code in appendix.
 - [x] Theory for the multiphase model and neural networks.
 - [x] Group the plots so they take up a bit less space.
 - [x] Summary table of the performances of all models.
 - [x] Supervisor corrections
