Much of the code was written from scratch for this peoject, or is a close to direct translation of the formulas described in papers such as %\cite{grigor20}.

\subsection{Datasets}

Country-based data 

Originally used data from \cite{ecdcdata},  but the ECDC switched from a daily to a weekly update from 14 December 2020. Therefore, I have chosen to use the data from  \cite{countrydata}, which has remained daily

Ireland cases by county are from \cite{irelanddata}
