\section{Source Code and Data Sources}
\label{ch:codesource}

Much of the code was written from scratch for this project, or is a close to direct translation of the formulas described in papers such as Grigorian's \cite{grigor20}.

\subsection{R packages}

\noindent

\verb|ggplot2|  \cite{ggplot2} is widely used for easily plotting and visualising the models. 

\verb|rgdal| \cite{rgdal} allows geospatial \verb|.shp| files to be read into \verb|R|. 

\verb|raster| \cite{raster} allows this data to be manipulated and plotted. 

\verb|dplyr| \cite{dplyr}  provides useful data manipulation functions, both for models and geospatial mapping. 

Statistical models (HoltWinters, ARIMA and Neural Network Regression) were readily implemented from \verb|forecast| \cite{forecast}.

The majority ofthe colours for plotting are selected using colour palettes from the \verb|wesanderson| package \cite{wesanderson20}.

\subsection{Shapefiles and Datasets}

This data includes the geospatial vector data which can be used to \textit{draw} country (and county) coastlines and borders. 

World country shape data was obtained from \cite{countryshape}, while the more detailed county-level shapefile for Ireland was downloaded from \cite{countyshape}.

\underline{Country-level data:}

I have chosen to use the data from  \cite{countrydata}, which has detailed daily data for nearly 200 countries and territories.

\underline{Ireland county-level data:}

Downloaded from \cite{irelanddata} and used to visualise the 14-day incidence rate per 1 million of the population, for each county.

\subsection{Source Code}

All the code, plots, and even this report, are available at my \href{https://github.com/gibbona1/TCD_FinalYearProject}{GitHub}. 

I will include the main code files in text below.
